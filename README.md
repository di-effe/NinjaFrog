# About

NinjaFrog is my first real game and has been mainly a learning exercise, to better understand Heaps, Haxe, LDtk and Deepnight's gamebase code and libraries.
It's not a perfect game by any stretch, but it was fun and I enjoyed every bug, issue and of course every little success.

This is a small puzzle game, heavely inspired (something more than ispired I admit) by the beautiful Pixel Frog art.
His demo levels are so nice, complete and full of ideas, that I couldn't resist the urge to try to replicate on my own at least of fraction of them.
Pixel Adventure's demo is more fun than my game, but I saw this grow from a single sprite to what you can see now, and I'm proud of it :)
